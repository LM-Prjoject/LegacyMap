-- ==================== DATABASE PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS ====================

-- 1. Check table sizes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) AS size_bytes
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;

-- 2. Check index usage
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan as index_scans,
    idx_tup_read as tuples_read,
    idx_tup_fetch as tuples_fetched,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- 3. Find unused indexes
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    indexname,
    idx_scan,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(indexrelid)) as index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND idx_scan = 0
  AND indexrelid NOT IN (
      SELECT indexrelid FROM pg_index WHERE indisunique OR indisprimary
  )
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(indexrelid) DESC;

-- 4. Check missing indexes (tables with sequential scans)
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan,
    seq_tup_read,
    idx_scan,
    seq_tup_read / seq_scan as avg_seq_tup_read
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND seq_scan > 0
ORDER BY seq_tup_read DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 5. Check cache hit ratio (should be > 99%)
SELECT 
    sum(heap_blks_read) as heap_read,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) as heap_hit,
    sum(heap_blks_hit) / (sum(heap_blks_hit) + sum(heap_blks_read)) * 100 as cache_hit_ratio
FROM pg_statio_user_tables;

-- 6. Check active connections
SELECT 
    datname,
    count(*) as connections,
    count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'active') as active,
    count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle') as idle,
    count(*) FILTER (WHERE state = 'idle in transaction') as idle_in_transaction
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY datname;

-- 7. Check long running queries
SELECT 
    pid,
    now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start AS duration,
    query,
    state
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE (now() - pg_stat_activity.query_start) > interval '5 seconds'
  AND state != 'idle'
ORDER BY duration DESC;

-- 8. Check table bloat
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS total_size,
    n_dead_tup,
    n_live_tup,
    round(n_dead_tup * 100.0 / NULLIF(n_live_tup + n_dead_tup, 0), 2) AS dead_tuple_percent
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND n_dead_tup > 0
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;

-- 9. Check most frequently accessed tables
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    seq_scan + idx_scan as total_scans,
    seq_scan,
    idx_scan,
    n_tup_ins as inserts,
    n_tup_upd as updates,
    n_tup_del as deletes
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY total_scans DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 10. Vacuum and analyze recommendations
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    last_vacuum,
    last_autovacuum,
    last_analyze,
    last_autoanalyze,
    n_dead_tup
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND (last_autovacuum IS NULL OR last_autovacuum < now() - interval '7 days')
ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;

-- ==================== RECOMMENDATIONS ====================

-- Run VACUUM ANALYZE on tables with high dead tuple count
-- VACUUM ANALYZE table_name;

-- Update table statistics
-- ANALYZE;

-- Reindex if needed
-- REINDEX TABLE table_name;
